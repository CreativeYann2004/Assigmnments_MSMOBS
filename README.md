## Task1
a) No the reaction rate is different in a linear pathway because it does not represent an equilibrium state but the expression rate under the assumption that the required molecules are available.
b) EX_etoh_e and EX_acald_e have no data available to them they cannot be derived from gene expression since they are not expressed but come from external sources
