## AI Usage Guidelines

We use **GitHub Copilot** for code auto-completion.  
All generated suggestions were carefully reviewed and validated, ensuring we fully understood the code in order to complete each assignment.

We also used DeepL Write to improve the structure of the sentences.

Propmts:
import common

def main():
# Load the E. coli core model
# Store expression data from the CSV file as the command reference suggests
# Apply constraints based on the assignment instructions
model, expression_data = common.get_model_with_constraints()

if name == "main":

can you make j√¢vadoc style comnments instead please

can you make javadoc style comments instead

I have added JavaDoc-style comments to your code to clearly describe the main function and its steps.
